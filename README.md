# Cassandra Lab

This is a study project for [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/), which will include attempts to:
 - access Cassandra 'natively' via [CQL](http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/old/CQL-3.0.html)(SH)
 - access Cassandra through Scala using the [Phantom](https://github.com/outworkers/phantom) library
