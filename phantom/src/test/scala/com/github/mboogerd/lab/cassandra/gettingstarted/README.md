# Getting Started

This package is my implementation for [A series on Phantom â€“ Part 1: Getting started with phantom](http://outworkers.com/blog/post/a-series-on-phantom-part-1-getting-started-with-phantom). It shows the creation of a table, as well as persisting to - and retrieving an item from it.
